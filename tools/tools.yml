  description: >
    The arrangement of hypotheses in a hierarchical structure appears in many 
    research fields and often indicates different resolutions at which data

    should best be interpreted on. treeclimbR provides a flexible method to 
    select optimal resolution levels (potentially different levels in different 
    parts of the tree), rather than cutting the tree at an arbitrary level.
